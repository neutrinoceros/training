## Scope
This is a simple introduction to `git`.
In this document, you will learn the fundamentals of version-control, and we'll cover the following skills

- create and setup a git project (`git init`)
- add and remove files (`git add`, `git rm`)
- check-in new changes (`git commit`)
- synchronize your local and remote copies of a project (`git pull`, `git push`)
- navigate the change history (`git log`, `git checkout`)
- working with multiple branches (`git branch`, `git merge`)
- resolve history conflict
- visualize the current state (`git status`, `git diff`, `git branch`)

Of course,mMastering `git` goes well beyond the scope of the present document.
In particular, the following topics will *not* be covered, but are no less important:

- collaboration (sharing a project with other persons)
- editing the history (`git rebase`)
- bisecting the history to look for bugs (`git bisect`)
